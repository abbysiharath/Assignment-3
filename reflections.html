        <h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
        <br />        
        1. Assignment 3 was like assignment 2 as the group was very well communicated. The show up rate for meetings was 100%, which allowed us to get work done efficiently and effectively. Tasks were split up evenly and each team member contributed an appropriate amount of work despite having other assignments due.  

        Things that could’ve been improved were to state clear objectives each week so that everyone in our group had mental clarity on what needed to be done.  
        
        One thing that surprised me was how easy it is to work online in 2022, with the power of cloud computing allowing us to work virtually without technological barriers.  
        
        One thing I have learned is that groups can be a fun way to learn and get work done as each member brings a different view on the work providing value to the assignment. This experience made me want to work as a group more often. 

        <br><br>
        2. Working with the group in assignment 3 felt much more communicative and fluent compared to assignment 2. Over the weeks we built on chemistry allowing us to be more comfortable and communicative with each other, which made rearranging meetings, completing work etc. easier. Everyone contributed very well and completed a lot of the work before the actual due date. 
 
        Things that could have been improved were properly assigning work to which people. We all just decided to do our own task/work and fortunately it did work out, however it would have been better to state who is doing what work. 

        One thing that surprised me was most of the work was completely done before the week of the due date which gave us a lot of free time to review our project. 

        One thing I have learnt about the group was how enjoyable it was to work online. Working online could be difficult if you work with people that do not contribute or communicate. Working with this functional group compared to my previous groups showed me how fun group projects are. 

        <br><br>
        3. What went well was that we all contributed well and that some members would work on the theory and report while some members would on building the site. I worked on the report and our members all listened to our opinions and ideas and we picked the best one or feature. For me personally I could have improved by focusing on making the website more as I think it would have sped up our process. The surprising thing was that we did this whole project online and managed to put it together in under a month.  

        One thing that I learnt about groups is that everyone has different abilities, and our strengths and weaknesses helped us gain more skills and experience for future projects. I think the GitHub log of activity reflects our group work on the assignment well. 

        <br><br>
        4. We worked very well as a group, and I think we have done a very good job on the assignment. We all communicated very well with each other which can be seen in how long our meetings went for. We had multiple meetings each week, the first meeting we would discuss what we need to do and the direction of where the website is headed and then the second meeting would be us checking up on each other and seeing how we are going and providing help if anyone needs it. If anyone couldn’t make it to the meetings, we would have it without them and give them a summary of what we discussed or we would push it back so they could make it. We all shared the work very well amongst all of us. People who were more experienced in coding handled the websites and the others would focus more on the theory. We all still contributed to the website and theory, but some contributed more to one of them. Even when we were not talking about work, we still got along well. We would be asking each other about how they’re going and asking about what they’ve been up to. 
        
        <br><br>
        5. There were no real issues working with this group. This assignment we took a different approach to the last one; members worked on various aspects of the assignment individually and contributed where they could best. This method came with quite a slow start to any noticeable progress, mainly because there was confusion on what the project actually was, what we wanted to achieve and how we wanted to present it. When these questions were answered each member put in their utmost effort to make up for the lack of progress in the first few weeks of the assignment. Luckily this time we didn’t have any issues with meeting attendance (no one getting sick!!), and although it often took some time to get things rolling in meetings, the team would eventually become productive in no time. When we all had something to work on, and being in meetings together to keep eachother in check, was when we were most productive.

            In this assignment the group continued their methods of effective and frequent communication. Members continued to provide feedback while remaining respective of each other, making it effortless to settle on ideas when they were open and accepting of multiple opinions.  
            
            <br><br>
        
          <li>
            In comparison to the last assignment, progress was quite slow but that lack of progress was made up for in the weeks nearing submission. This will be reflected in the GitHub logs which will show the lack of activity towards the beginning of the project, but then a dramatic increase in activity towards the end. 

            <br><br>

          <li>
            The team as a whole agrees how technology has evolved into such a big part of our everyday lives, and how easy it is now to work online. Reflecting on the work we achieved over the past few months, completely online and with time constraints, was an eye-opener. Using programs such as GitHub, Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Teams greatly helped us progress efficiently through these assignments. 

            <br><br>
        
          <li>
            An area for improvement could be setting weekly milestones. In future, such milestones can help to better meet project deadlines and improve progress. Goals will improve team collaboration when members have a clearer understanding of what tasks need to be fulfilled and by when. In the beginning of a project, group members could gather to form a visual timeline that would help guide them throughout the assignment.  

            <br><br>
        
          <li>
            Finally, members recognized the importance of building chemistry in the team. Outside of assignment talk, the group would occasionally check up on each-others as well as progress in other classes. Getting to know each-other in the last assignment allowed for flawless communication and effective teamwork. In this assignment the strengths of members began to show, as some would take control of website creation while others would apply writing skills towards improving report content. Overall, the team are appreciative to learn how enjoyable group work can be if members are respectful, understanding and contribute equally.
