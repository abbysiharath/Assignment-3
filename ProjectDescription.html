        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Topic</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our goal is to create the ultimate app for students. We want to create an app that can make school life a little bit easier for students. Whether it is helping to organize their work or helping them find food. We aim to allow students ease of access to many prominent features. Like a messaging service to communicate with other students, maps to find places to study, shared calendar to easily organise events, have all their assessments clearly displayed for them, and even clearly layout a study plan to be followed. 
          <br><br></p>
        <p>
          We believe that this app will help to release the stress of being a student by helping to organise them or help to motivate them. This app will be an educational app as well as a social app as we want to have students connected to each other in a simple and easy to understand way that can be accessed at any time. We know that many of these features will reduce stress on students and help to save time or manage their time, so that they have more hours in a day to hang out with friends, do homework, and have free time.  
        </p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          We aim to improve the quality of life for students and to improve communication between other students and teachers. We also want to listen to students and give them features that they want/need. As schooling can be very stressful, we believe that helping to organise and motivate students will reduce stress and lead to a better schooling experience. Currently apps are very mainstream in IT as the ability to have everything you need in your pocket is very convenient and having everyone and everything connected via an app helps to optimize every day. This would show future employees that we are able to identify consumer needs and trends and create something that fulfills these needs. 
        </p>

        <h3>Landscape</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently there a similar systems or products available such as CANVAS and Google Classrooms.  CANVAS doesn’t currently have a map feature like our app. It does but the teacher usually has to add it in notifications. For our app the students and teachers can just find the maps on the dashboard shortcut. There will be a special page just for maps. Our app also helps improve mental health for students because finding classes and finding groups for a project can be a problem that stresses them out. Currently Google Classrooms cannot do this itself and the teacher or students must do it.  
          <br><br></p>
        <p>
          With our app, students will have suggestions feature if the students give us permission to show their interests information or course name so the app can match them with other students to make friends even before their classes start. With our app it can schedule meetings and find out on a calendar the most suitable time for students to meet to interact for school activities and non-related school activities too. With CANVAS and Google Classrooms, we had to go to outlook and manually find a timeslot available for all of us. RMIT has clubs but you would need to go directly to the club location and sign up and canvas and google homes doesn’t really help you with this. Our app helps students find clubs to join and will have a page where it shows which clubs are available to join.  
          <br><br></p>
        <p>
          Our app can also locate teachers for students and currently canvas and google homes can't do this as we usually must email or ask where teachers are and whether they are available at the time the student checks the app. You won’t even need to email the teacher as it will show every student enrolled in the specific class if their teacher is available for consultation. Currently to break assignments into smaller parts students on CANVAS would have to use a separate program such as Trello. Our app also breaks assessment or discussion classes into smaller parts which CANVAS currently does not do.

        <h2>Detailed Description</h2>


        <h3>Roles</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Towards the beginning of the project no specific roles were defined. This was to encourage contribution of each member of the group across varying aspects of the assignment, and so no one person would have a huge weight on their shoulders from the responsibility of completing an area alone. Each week would shed light on the specific tasks required completion in order to progress onto new ones in following weeks. However, as the group continued to work together, members’ strengths began to show. In areas where some would struggle or be unable to contribute to much, others would shine in. Even if roles were not defined in a specific way such as technical designer and lead developer, tasks were allocated to members based not only on the usual factors such as urgency and level of difficulty, but now the skill sets of the group, and how duties could be fulfilled by putting best to use members’ strengths in key areas.  
      
          <br><br></p>  
        <p>
          For example, when it came to creation of the decided project - a website - a database was required to store information received from user input. With the knowledge that some of the team had been learning SQL in other classes, those members expressed their lack of confidence in using SQL with data management. Due to this, a member who was more experienced in this area decided to take control and apply their skills towards finding a program that would not be too intensive in linking to the website. In saying this, those who were more confident in the technical design of the website focused on that, while others who weren’t naturally worked on getting theory done or pulling their weight in an area which they more comfortable in.  

          <br><br></p> 
        <p>
          So, while roles were not defined for team members specifically, their skills and attributes were considered in the allocation of tasks in a process that would allow group objectives to be achieved in a timely and effective manner. There is an unspoken trust within the group that each member will put forth their utmost effort in each tasks needed to be worked on, and in the case one member does not have the skills to do that, communication will be used to seek assistance from teammates more self-assured in that area. It is felt there is no particular need, at least for the time being, for member specific roles to be allocated, but there is an understanding that this would be of great importance in future opportunities when working in a group environment. 

          <br><br></p> 

        <h3>Scopes & Limits</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The objective of the “Study Buddy” project is to improve student life, with a focus on enhancing both student-student and student-mentor communication. As there is a limited time to create a prototype, only a few features of the application will be showcased to display the future vision for what the project could become. Initially, the appication was intended to be one that would be available for mobile phones.  
          <br><br></p>  
        <p>
          After careful consideration and receiving feedback from the teacher, the group has decided it would be best to present a website version of the mobile app. One of many reasons is - building a mobile application from scratch is, at the moment, too far outside the skill set of the team members. Building a website, however, is something more within reach, and would be able to demonstrate the skills learned throughout classes such as using HTML and CSS to build, format and customise websites.  

          <br><br></p>  
        <p>
          The prototype will display a rough format of the website version of the Study Buddy, showing various tabs such as ‘dashboard’, ‘community’ and ‘study spaces’, but due to time restraints will not be completed to its entirety. For the sake of presentation the project will feature a map highlighting locations of the RMIT campuses. It is also aimed to display various locations for student use, such as study spaces and places to find food etc, although these additions to the map feature may be difficult to achieve. Another deliverable for the prototype will be a contact form. This feature will be used by the targeted audience, students. Information received from these forms will be stored in a server, categorising student names, university IDs, any contact information and of course their comments or queries. The end product is intended to include a student verification system in these contact forms, but will not be featured in this prototype of the application. 
          
          <br><br></p>  

        <h3>Tools & Technology</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Software & other tools:
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>Database programs such as MongoDB or SQL - for storage of user information  </li>
  
          <li>Cloud services such as Azure, Amazon web services - for user view of posts, images and other content uploaded onto the application </li>
  
          <li>Wix - for basic interface design of application (both website & mobile) </li>
  
          <li>GitHub - for the building and publishing of the website version </li>
  
          <li>Visual Studio Code - live code editing  </li>
          <br />
          <br><br></p>  

        <p>
          Team Experience with the above:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
        
            <li>Group members have experience in HTML, which will be used for building the structure of the website, and CSS, for the formatting of the website. Wix is great for customising the interface of the application as it allows designing for both a website and mobile version, but does not require any coding languages - this will not demonstrate our understanding and skills of HTML/CSS and other languages learned throughout the course. On the other  hand, the use of repositories on GitHub will not only ensure our coding skills are put to use, but will also display members’ activities and contributions to the formation of the website application. Group members are also familiar with both GitHub and Visual Studio Code from prior assignments, so using the pair will reduce any complications that could occur throughout the project. 

            <br><br>
          
            <li>Group members have experience in the use of SQL databases, but the lack of it influences the decision to work with a different program in the storage of user information and other content that may be received by the application. 

            <br><br>
          </ul>
          <br><br></p>  


        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The project will be tested by our teachers and random students that are still in university as students are our main motivation for this project. We will ask random students who volunteer to give us feedback for our website. We will find 5 random students online with a diverse variety of backgrounds and ages from our social media friend list. It should be simpler than CANVAS so therefore anyone can test the project. We can measure if it successful by checking the website traffic and by reviewing the feedback given by the students. There should be 80% of good reviews if our project was successful.  
          
          <br><br></p>  

        <h3>Time-frame</h3>
        <br />
          

        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Some risks for this project are that sometimes the site breaks down while multiple of us were working on it. Sometimes it did not allow multiple users to work on it and this delayed our project progress a little although we still found a solution for it. Delaying the process can cause the participants that test this to have a bad reptation of our project and they may not want to use it in the future. Another risk was that it caused our formatting to change, and this is a risk as users may not like websites that are not user-friendly. Most sites are successful due to their attractive designs and the easy navigation.  

          <br><br></p>  

        <h3>Group Processes & Communication</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Communication was great in our group between our group members. Our group communicated via Microsoft Teams. We also had a backup platform to communicate on and it was Facebook Messenger as sometimes our team call notifications don’t appear on our desktop or phones. We had around 2 meetings each week. Sometimes we would have 3 meetings a week and they often took place on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. Our short meetings took around 20 minutes, and our longer meetings took around over 30 minutes. Our meetings were conducted online with our webcams and microphones on. If we had a group member who did not communicate, we would text them on Messenger. Sometimes certain group members could not attend but our nice team members prepared a summary for the person away to catch up on and which tasks they needed to complete before our next meeting.
