        <br> I am 20 and I live in Woodend which is an hour out of Melbourne towards Bendigo. I do tennis training and 
          competition tennis once a week. I like to take my dog for walks and giving him treats. I play video games and watch tv shows and movies. 
          I am currently playing Doom Eternal and watching The Boys. I like to hang out with my friends and play games with them. Last year I was enrolled in 
          the Bachelor of Business: Information Systems but I really didn’t enjoy it so I changed to the Bachelor of Information Technology. I like to mess 
          around on computers and solve issues for my family. I really enjoy coding and have been really liking learning about it. I did an IT class in year 9 
          and built my own computer as well as working on assignments for other classes.

        <br> Student ID: S3900851
        <br> I am a second year uni student studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I recently transferred from engineering into IT 
          because I enjoyed the programming side of my previous course. Information technology also appealed to me due to its career prospects and wide range 
          of qualifications. Nevertheless, I’ve always found interest in working with technology and love to learn about it, which is probably a strength of mine. 
          Since young I’ve been asked to solve issues in technology whether present in the classroom or home environment. I have some people in my life that have 
          studied/are studying IT, and this encouraged me further to take up the program. Unfortunately I do not have any outstanding IT experience to date, 
          but am keen to get into the industry to gain some. I'm fluent in English and Laotian, and studied Japanese throughout school (although probably rusty now), 
          and have an interest in sports - I played basketball during every lunch/recess throughout school, and now play casually, I have been coaching two junior teams since December 2021; have been playing badminton 
          since the beginning of the year. I enjoy recreational activities in my spare time, like hiking or playing guitar.

        <br> Student ID: S3909873
        <br> Hi! My name is Daniel La, I am 19 years old, and my date of birth is the 22nd of January 2003. My nationality is Vietnamese and Chinese, 
          as my mum being full Vietnamese and dad being half Vietnamese and half Chinese. Growing up, both my parents taught me their national language, 
          so I can fundamentally speak and understand a few languages such as Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Hakka. 
          For my education, I was a high school graduate of 2020 from Wellington Secondary College who studied English, Chinese, Math's Methods, Accounting, 
          Economics and Psychology. I previously enrolled and studied Bachelor of Computer Science last year, however the course layout and content were not 
          to my interest, thus now I am studying IT. During my free time, I have hobbies of listen to music, watching videos, play many games like Valorant, 
          exercising and attend social gatherings. A few interesting facts about me is that my favorite artist is Khalid, I love watching videos such as YouTube, 
          movies, Netflix, anime etc and my favorite food is Pho, a popular traditional Vietnamese dish.

        <br> Student ID: S3722873
        <br> Hello, my name is Mi and it’s pronounced as me, and I was born in Melbourne. I am completing a Bachelor of Business degree. 
          My nationality is Vietnamese, and I am fluent in the language. Aside from Vietnamese, I can communicate in basic Italian. 
          I have two dogs and like sports. My favourite topics in school were sports and business. I enjoy listening to music and dancing with my friends. 
          League of Legends, Valorant, and PUBG are some of my favourite games. When I taste food, I can determine what components were used in the dish. 
          My other hobbies include spending time with my family, watching TV and watching travel vlogs. I also enjoy going to music concerts and watching 
          sports events live. I have experience in creating a website and making databases using Microsoft Excel. I have always had an interest in IT since 
          I was young, and I used to fix other people’s computers in class when something went wrong.

        <br> Student ID: S3849200 
        <br> Hi! My name is Dylan Adams, I am 21 and currently enrolled in my final semester as a student at RMIT. 
          I am born and raised in Eastern Melbourne Australia where I have undertaken my high school studies at St. Joseph's College Ferntree Gully. 
          I am also involved in a local football team (Upper Ferntree Gully) where I spend most of my Saturday’s playing & supporting the club. 
          My other hobbies include gaming, spending most of the time playing Fortnite as well as playing the guitar. 
          I also have 2 dogs, one named Spud who is 14 and a border collie, and another named Letty, who is only 6 months and is the newest addition to our family.

        <h2>Group Processes</h2>
          <br />        
          Effective communication was a big part of how successfully the group worked together. Each participant was attentive and made an attempt to show up to meetings. These sessions were scheduled regularly (two per week was the goal), and when they weren't, it was rather simple to reschedule because other commitments like other classes, work schedules, or personal obligations were acknowledged.  
          <br></p></p>
          Members were also kept informed whether they had missed all or part of a meeting by using the meeting notes. Even while participants were often working on their own projects during meetings, they were often productive. Meetings, for instance, were supposed to last only a short while, but they frequently did, demonstrating the group's dedication. 
          <br></p></p>
          There were some meetings where nobody showed up for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, regardless of meetings, each participant gave the assignment their best effort. The group meetings should be scheduled more efficiently; finding an extension that allows members’ input for availabilities.  
          <br></p></p>
          The group as a whole agrees that the development was a little slow. They said it would be perfect if some of the assignments were finished and turned in a little earlier than they were. Additionally, getting started on the project idea earlier will be an excellent idea. In Assignment 2, with the teacher's assistance, the group chose to tackle a fresh idea, but this aspect of the assignment wasn't really addressed until the final few days before submission. Hopefully in this final assignment the project idea won’t be dismissed until the final week, and instead it can be worked on gradually with a foolproof process plan.

          <h2>Career Plans</h2>
            <br />        
              The professional paths of our group are rather similar. Even though each candidate is vying for a different position, they all have complementary skills and traits. As a group, we realised that fundamental skills like knowing how to use Microsoft and programming are interchangeable in the IT industry. 
              <br></p></p>
              When comparing the talents and prerequisites for our dream occupations, it becomes clear that soft skills like communication, time management, and the capacity for teamwork are frequently valued over hard skills. In terms of hard skills, we all need to have prior knowledge of Microsoft (excel, windows, etc.). Before applying for a full-time career, more specialised occupations increasingly require knowledge of java, html, completion of credentials (CCNA), and of course years of experience.  
              <br></p></p>
              The group would be well-suited to activities like system management, data management, and programming. You need to be proficient in coding languages like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to be a front-end developer. This can be different for a digital strategist's job, which necessitates a deeper knowledge of marketing. Despite the fact that they are both IT-related, they are completely different professions with extremely different duties and demands. 
              <br></p></p>
              After analysing the burning glass data from Assignment 2, along with feedback from Assignment 1&2 and further research, some of our group members’ perspectives on their ideal jobs has slightly changed. Although they do not yet have a clear cut vision on the position they’d want to pursue, the factors mentioned above have encouraged them to keep an open mind and consider all alternatives.  
              <br></p></p>
              This is generally due to the discovery that skills learned and experience obtained on the journey to becoming an IT professional can be transferrable across a majority of jobs in the industry. Skills like writing, troubleshooting, and planning may not be prerequisites like knowledge in a coding language, but would make our daily lives a lot more efficient, increase employability and make workloads less demanding. 
              <br></p></p>
              In saying this, some group members are also encouraged to follow a straight road and achieve the one position they’ve set their eyes on. Strong demand for careers in the IT sector helps with this, considering that IT has and will continue to have a great impact on the world. Nevertheless, there is the security that in the event of a career change, skills that have been learned will be transferrable to other jobs both in and outside the IT industry.
